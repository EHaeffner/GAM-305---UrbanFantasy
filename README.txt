************************************************************

-Testing Progress –

-Bugs identified – 
•	Camera switching between rooms could get stuck
•	First room camera was not connected to it’s trigger box correctly
•	Checkpoint SFX go off every time the player runs by and turn in front of them
	o	The end points music can stack to the point of crashing.
•	Wall jump is overtuned, jumps can cross most of the room.
•	Dying reattaches the camera to the player character rather than the room
•	Checkpoint’s respawned outside of the map

-What would we do differently?-
•	Working on the QA and testing together more so than we did this time
	o	Due to the time constraints and scheduling conflicts, we were not able to meet up enough to efficiently test the game as a group more than once or twice.
-Tools used-
•	Effective – GitHub has been the main way our team has shared the files and resources of our game with each other. We ran into some issues early on with everyone getting properly connected to it, but now we are all mostly on the same page. We have also been using discord twice a week to perform meetings and check-ins, as well as constant messages almost daily as we work together on this project.
•	Ineffective – The main tools that we chose to use for this project have been useful in each way we’ve used them. GitHub did give us some issues early on, but not in a way that hindered our project for very long.
•	The teams early approach to planning what tools to use when analyzing the game design document allowed us to quickly get started with setting everything up. Since there was no arguments or disagreements on what we were using or who was creating it, we were able to begin right at the start of week 3.



***************************************************
*5-2 Project Log: Team Reflection and Beta Release*
***************************************************


What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go well in relation to the last stage evaluation?
•	A lot of the progress that was made was cleaning up the various aspects we added in the alpha. We are still on track with the planned schedule and will have most things ready for the beta. Communication has been strong between all of the team members. When an issue arises, everyone is ready and willing to present it to the team to get fixed in a timely manner.
What parts of the plan did the team perceive to go wrong in relation to the last stage evaluation?
•	Scheduling has remained an issue throughout this entire project, but in some ways that is to be expected in an online class with people we don’t know personally. Another issue that has popped up recently is issues with merging into the main repository. We have resolved all of the issues that have arisen and will continue to communicate with each other and the instructor as needed.
How were the previous evaluations integrated into this latest stage?
•	We discussed the tools we were using and decided to change how we were using them, such as reorganizing our Trello board. We have been using Discord to communicate more than ever as we approach the end of this project. Some of the bugs and other issues with the game were looked at and given a priority based on severity, then were fixed as we went based on need.
What would you do differently to improve the collaboration or development process?
•	The biggest change that could be made would be discussing schedules as soon as possible with groups to try and line up times that discussions can be had about the project. Utilizing organizational tools, such as Discord, to their fullest extent as soon as possible would also help. We have been using a group chat on Discord, but having a server where we can organize and post in a cleaner format would have probably help as we got started.
Were there any tools or techniques that you did not find helpful in the success of your project development? Why?
•	None of the tools or technics that we decided to use ended up being unhelpful or useless. Discord allowed us to communicate and share resources. GitHub is the basis of sharing the project and updates between us. Trello has kept our bugs and progress organized. The main reason these programs worked for us was because at least one person knew how to use these programs ahead of time and were able to effectively share the best ways to utilize them for the purposes we intended.
Identify the completed stage of development of the intended Beta and address the project schedule to meet Final Release development deadline.
•	We are slightly behind the intended schedule of where we wanted to be for the beta release, but we plan to get caught up by the due date on Sunday. Everyone’s schedule this week has been very hectic due to a variety of factors, but as the weekend goes on we will finish the goals and have the beta branch ready to go. Final Release will be ready on time based on our current trajectory, and we don’t see any reason we will have to change the schedule or remove any currently planned features.
